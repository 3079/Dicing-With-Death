# Dicing-With-Death

You can play the game [here](https://3079.itch.io/dicing-with-death)

Dicing with Death is a puzzle game where you play as a die that has a laser beam shooting straight out of it's 4-facet (as 4 means death in Japanese). Your goal is to destroy all the monsters on the level while making sure not to attack any peaceful shibas. You can roll around, rotate the camera and undo your actions. On the last level you get the ability to swap between two dice. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to implement more levels using two dice. The restart level function was also implemented, but doesn't work for whatever reason.
This game was made in 48 hours as a GMTK GameJam 2022 entry.  

You can roll around, rotate camera and destroy monsters with the laser beam.
